Before I started the full stack development curriculum, I did a little bit of the free bootcamp prep.

They said that was recommended when applying for the scholorship, just so you know what you're getting

yourself into.  So I worked a little with that, some came easy to me some didn't.  That was when I learned 

about screensharing as well as chatting with coaches.  When I spoke to one via screenshare, I informed him of 

my background and asked what he would recommend that I go for once I get done with the curriculum. Seeing as

I am more of the creative type, being a musician and all,  he thought that the front end side would be good for me.

Then I did another screenshare with someone and learned that a heavy portion of this curriculum was backend.

That explained why I was having so much trouble at first.  However, I was then reassured that flatiron teaches you 

everything, rather than focusing on one thing.  I think to prepare you the most for when it's time to meet with the 

career coach and start applying.  I was also told, if you can learn one thing you can learn the other no problem.
