For my CLI GEM project I decided on the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village website.

To be honest, when I first started it with the clean slate I was pretty overwhelmed not knowing what to do.

I never really cared for Ruby due to learning that where I come from, it's not used.  But hey, it's always good to learn something new, even if you don't use it.  Ok, so while going over this website I selected, I came upon the shops and dining part.  I was looking at the different restaurants they have there, so I selected three of them and decided to scrape the menus of each restaurant.  To my surprise the more I got into it, the faster it went.  So for the cli.rb, made it so it would return "Welcome to the Henry Ford." or something like that.  Then I made a restuarant class because I'm scraping restaurnats.  Then what I did was took the exact URL for each restuarant's menu and made it into a string in a hash.  I was basically making links so the user could access the menus that way, but apparantly that doesn't want to work.  I also used itoraters like each do, etc, as well as the self keywords.  There's just this one thing that when I run the code, instead of showing the restaurants, it just returns an empty array. Not even the last tech coach could figure that out.  This may not be the best, but this is my first project so please bear with me.  But again, once I really got into it, I had a good time with it and learned quite a bit.
