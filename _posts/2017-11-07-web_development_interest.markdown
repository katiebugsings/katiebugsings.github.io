Hi there! Welcome to my blog.  This is my first time blogging so bear with me.
I first heard of Flatiron School on the Channel 4 News.
The first thing that sparked my interest was the job guarantee upon completion.
I contacted the school itself for more information.  That was when I learned of the scholorship
for women, which I am a proud recipiant of.  I was a music major in college, with a focus on opera.
One reason I decided to learn this was that I'm very good at computers, and upon learning that you
can also utilize any passion with web development.
