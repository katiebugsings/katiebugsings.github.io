I finally completed the Introduction to Ruby.  As I said in my last blogging post, 

it was tough, but I did it.  A tech coach even said to me during one screenshare 

that he could tell that I'm learning and I couldn't agree more.  In my experience with 

Flatiron so far, everyone is so supportive and easy to talk to, which is great.  Now my focus 

is time management here.  This does take up alot of time, and again, it can be hard to focus on

while working full time and maintaining a social life as well as sanity.  I met with my dad over the weekend 

and told him about my coursework, and whether or not I should quit my job and focus on this to finish sooner.

In my first blog I mentioned that I intend to graduate by April.  We did a little number crunching, and came up 

with that if I don't do anything and complete three modules a month, my goal would easily be obtainable. I hope 

I can do that.  Stay tuned!
