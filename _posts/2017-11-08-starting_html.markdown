Tonight I began a new module called HTML and CSS.  These I looked forward to because based on

what I've learned so far, I think I would be more geared towards front end development.  As I started watching 

these videos, I felt more familiar with HTML than Ruby. I think that's because back when I was a freshman in 

college, I had what I believe was a computer programming class and I was recalling things from it, such as 

how to build your own webpage.  I'm anxious to see what the rest of the front end course has to offer.
