When I first started the full stack web developmet curriculum, the first part came easy, but during the intro to Ruby I started to really struggle and become discouraged.  It's probably because it was so new to me and I was't used to it.
But now I'm on HTML and CSS.  So far I've been having fun with that like being able to create an album cover, brochure,
and I just finished Issue Bot 9000, where you get to edit the code to find out what's wrong like a puzzle.  It scared me at first, but as I worked through it, it actually started to make me feel a little better.
