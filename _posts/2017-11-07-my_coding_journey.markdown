I've been doing this since the end of August.  My goal is to be finished by April at least.

It's kind of hard while working full time, but I'm determined! While working through the intro, 

I thought it was impossible at first because it was all new to me.  I had never even heard of 

Ruby as a language.  I will admit that I would get impatient and discouraged, but I was reassured

through screenshares and video meetings with instructors and mentors, that once I got through the introduction,

I would be used to the workflow and it would all become smoother and go faster.  I can do this!
